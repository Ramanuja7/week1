Circular Economy Product Reuse Predictor
Overview
This project leverages AI/ML to predict the circular potential of consumer products—specifically, the likelihood that an item will be reused, repaired, refurbished, or recycled rather than landfilled. By analyzing product metadata, user behavior, and local infrastructure, the system empowers circular marketplace platforms, manufacturers, and policy-makers to design targeted interventions and optimize product lifecycle management for sustainability.​

Features
Multi-class prediction of product outcomes (reuse, repair, refurbish, recycle, landfill)

Dashboards for actionable recommendations

Explainable AI to highlight drivers of circular potential

Scalable architecture for multiple product categories

Dataset Sources
SDG Data Catalog: [Global sustainability data]​

Kaggle Sustainable Development Data: [Country/region sustainability indicators]​

Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI): [Product lifecycle, circular economy datasets]​

Resale platforms, municipal recycling logs, manufacturer disclosures (for additional product metadata and historical outcome)
